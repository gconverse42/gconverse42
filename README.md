Grace Converse - welcome to my Github, this is where I keep my Python projects! Eventually, I would like to do some work on Project Euler problems, cipher creation/breaking, and even larger projects like making a blockchain or a trading algorithm, but I'm new, so I'm starting with some toy projects.
